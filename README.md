## What's SunNetwork?


Sun Network is a project dedicated to building a trustful decentralized sidechain of TRON Blockchain. 
When completed, this project will greatly increase on-chain TPS rates, while decreasing the energy consumption of smart contract executions, which is very beneficial for both DAPP developers and the on-chain users of the TRON Blockchain.
